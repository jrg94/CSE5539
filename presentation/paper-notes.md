# Presentation Notes

On 4/15, I'll be presenting the following chapter and paper in class:

Goto M. (2006): “Analysis of musical audio signals,” In Wang D.L. & Brown G.J. (eds.):
Computational auditory scene analysis: Principles, algorithms, and applications. IEEE
Press/Wiley, Hoboken NJ, Chapter 8, pp. 251-295.

Rafii Z. and Pardo B. (2013): “REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): A simple
method for music/voice separation,” IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and
Language Processing, vol. 21, pp. 71-82.

Naturally, I'll be using this space to record my notes.
