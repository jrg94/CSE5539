\section*{Background}

As a first-year PhD student, my research background is very limited. That said,
I am interested in doing research in the area between music, education, gaming,
and data visualization.

To supplement these interests, I took three game development courses, a
computer graphics course, and a modeling and simulation course during undergrad.
In addition, I recently took a real-time rendering course, and I am
currently taking a data visualization course and a graphics seminar.

In terms of technical experience, I spent two years in industry working for
General Electric Transportation as a part of the Edison Engineering Development
Program. In the span of two years, I managed to rotate through various roles
including software engineer and prognostics engineer. The first role allowed
me to work on camera systems while the second role gave me experience with
some basic data analytics.

\section*{Aim}

Now state explicitly the hypothesis you aim to
test. Make references to the items listed in the Reference section
that back up your arguments for why this is a reasonable
hypothesis to test, for example the work of Knuth~\cite{knuth}.
Explain what you expect will be accomplished by undertaking this
particular project.  Moreover, is it likely to have any other
applications?

\section*{Method}

In this section you should outline how you intend to go
about accomplishing the aims you have set in the previous
section. Try to break your grand aims down into small,
achievable tasks. Try to estimate how long you will
spend on each task, and draw up a timetable for each
sub-task.

\section*{Software and Hardware Requirements}

For this project, I intend to use Python for both signal processing and
visualization.
