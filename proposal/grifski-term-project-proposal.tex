\section*{Background}

As a first-year PhD student, my research background is very limited. That said,
I am interested in doing research in the area between music, education, gaming,
and data visualization.

To supplement these interests, I took three game development courses, a
computer graphics course, and a modeling and simulation course during undergrad.
In addition, I recently took a real-time rendering course, and I am
currently taking a data visualization course and a graphics seminar.

In terms of technical experience, I spent two years in industry working for
General Electric Transportation as a part of the Edison Engineering Development
Program. In the span of two years, I managed to rotate through various roles
including software engineer and prognostics engineer. The first role allowed
me to work on camera systems while the second role gave me experience with
some basic data analytics.

\section*{Aim}

The aim of this project is to explore different audio signal processing methods
as a mode of data mining for the purposes of visualization. For example, I am
interested in collecting data such as loudness, onset density, and auditory
roughness~\cite{knuth}. In addition, I'd like to explore pitch and onset
detection.

\section*{Method}

Over the course of the semester, there are several small tasks that I would like
to complete:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
  \item The text in the entries may be of any length.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Software and Hardware Requirements}

For this project, I intend to use Python for both signal processing and
visualization. Signal processing can be done using the scipy library, and
visualization can be performed using any number of libraries such as
matplotlib and vtk.

In addition, I will need a rather large repository of music files. Luckily,
I have plenty myself as well as access to Spotify Premium.
