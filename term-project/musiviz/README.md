Welcome to musiviz, a term project for visualizing music files on my PC. The following
links are graphs that I've generated using various data files:

- [Duration vs. Purchase Date][1]
- [Duration vs. Release Date][2]
- [Genre Histogram][3]
- [dbFS vs. Release Date][4]
- [Average dBFS vs. Genre][5]
